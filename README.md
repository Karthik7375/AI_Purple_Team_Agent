# 🧠⚔️ Proactive AI Security Agent — Hybrid Red & Blue Team Assistant

- An autonomous, hybrid cybersecurity agent that integrates **Red Team** and **Blue Team** capabilities using AI.
- Built with **LangChain**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**, this agent leverages LLMs to interact with real-world security tools for automated offensive and defensive operations.

## 🔥 Features

### 🟥 Red Team Capabilities (IN PROGRESS)
- Automated enumeration & target discovery
- Vulnerability assessment and exploitation planning
- WAF and firewall evasion (dynamic payload generation)
- AI-assisted payload mutation and obfuscation
- Context-aware exploitation with LLM reasoning

### 🟦 Blue Team Capabilities (IN PROGRESS)
- Log and file analysis using AI
- Threat intelligence integration (via OSINT APIs)
- Malware signature scanning & behavior analysis
- AI-enhanced anomaly detection
- Automated alert triaging & response suggestions

### 🧠 AI-Driven Automation
- LLM-driven tool orchestration via LangChain
- Natural language interface for querying system state and issuing commands
- Modular architecture to add custom tools, workflows, and logic

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
This Project is a work-in progress. I have planned to continue this through another way (**LEARN + APPLY**).
I plan on Learning the concepts of advanced enumeration and exploitaion and then integrate them using AI Automation
